# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the first project of the New Responsive Web Design curriculum, completed till Step 54

**Thoughts:** Found the pedagogy really strange at first, without any video. But after a few steps, got the hang of it. Struggled on step 55. Couldn't understand the instruction clearly and ended the day on Step 54 itself.
